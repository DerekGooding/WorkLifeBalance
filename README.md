# WorkLifeBalance

This is a productivity app that keeps track of time, it can automatically toggle based on what window is in focus and also keep tracks of how much time you spent in other applications.You can customize what applications are considerated "work" and the app will try its best to toggle from working to resting and vice versa.
It has a window to compare current month productivity with last month productivity while also being able
to see each day activity separately.

It also consumes only 0.1% cpu so it was designed to be left opened everytime you stay on the computer and in theory it should work fine tho i did not test it yet so there might be some minor bugs!

Hover the mouse over the light blue line in the left to open a little menu from where you can access other options.

The app requires Administrator privileges so it can detect the apps that are also ran as Administrator.
